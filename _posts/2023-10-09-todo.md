Have you ever wanted to use something that could help track your daily life? Well if that piques your interest, the project I'll be talking about is a rather intriguing one. 

I'm working on a to-do list with the intention of helping users allocate their time management to their personal and work-related goals! It was a rather simple project that might look a bit confusing at first glance but I can promise you that once I explain things, you'll understand it enough to make one of your own.

To begin with, I started off by asserting two variables, one containing a list and another containing an empty string. This will come in really useful later when we initiate branching conditionals.

    Todo = []    
    Choices = ''

Next, I worked on the base of the whole project which was initiating a while loop. In order to make this project user-friendly, I needed to make a way for the loop to stop when said user wishes for it to. I did this by using the empty "Choices" variable That I created earlier and making it so that when the choices option appears, the user can just type "stop" to end the statement. This happens because the condition for the while loop is that it'll proceed with its iterations while the "Choices" variable is NOT equivalent to the strings "Stop", "stop", or "3". There are 2 different stops because computers are very specific with spelling so I put one in lowercase so that the mechanics are more user-friendly. 

 >Note: The reason there's and statements for the conditionals instead of or statements is because when you use the != (not equivalent) statement, it inverses their properties, make an and statement work as an or.
        
    while Choices != 'Stop' and Choices != '3' and Choices != 'stop' :


Now that the loop is initiated, we can start working on the main objective. I simply started off by showing simple print statements that tell the user their current Todos within their list. The word todo is put within the print statement since that's the name of our list.

    print('Your current todos are:')
    print(Todo)
    
After that, we can start working towards giving the user the ability to choose whether they want to add to the list, delete from the list, or stop the statement altogether. This is done through a simple input statement connecting to our empty "Choices" variable. 
    
    Choices = input('Please select an option. Current choices are "Add" : 1, "Delete" : 2 or "Stop" : 3 to stop:  ')

### The output of all this along side the previous code will be 
    Your current todos are:
    []

    Please select an option. Current choices are "Add" : 1, "Delete" : 2 or "Stop" : 3 to stop:

Continuing from that, we've now reached the point where we add the decision conditionals for "Add", "Delete" and "Stop".

In order to do that we must start off with an "if" Statement that tracks one of the three choices that we'll be working on. I started off by stating that if the "Choices" variable was equivalent to the strings "Add", "add" or "1", the iteration would proceed with the adding mechanic to let the user add whatever they may want into their to-do list.

>Note: There are multiple conditionals so that the user can type their responses however they place, allowing a more user-friendly interface. The or statement is also being used within this conditional because there isn't a "not" variant being applied to this conditional meaning or would work for allowing the conditional to pass as long as any of these are deemed true.

    if Choices == "Add" or Choices == 'add' or Choices == "1" :

Under this portion of conditionals, I'm able to start working on what really allows the user to add values to their to-do list. After the previous statement, I added another input statement connected to the variable "Addtodo", which allows them the type in whatever they may want to add to their list. Afterward, the item will be added to its list via the variable and a statement known as "append", which adds an item chosen to the very end of the list.

>Note:empty prints are for spacings, but there are better ways to do that.

    Addtodo = input('Please type in something to add to your todo list: ')
    Todo.append(Addtodo)
    print()
    print(Addtodo + ' has been added!')
    print()

### After all that, the follow should be printed:

    Please type in something to add to your todo list: Hello!

    Hello! has been added!

    Your current todos are:
    ['Hello!']

This segment is then repeated with the delete & add options, but the noticeable distinction is that the "if" statements are now "elif" statements.

>Note: Elifs are added instead of if statements because elifs are used as continuations to if statments meaning that if one of them are met, the if conditionals will just move on. 

        ##Delete Option 
        elif Choices == "Delete" or Choices == 'delete' or Choices == "2" :

        ##Stop Option
        elif Choices == "Stop" or Choices == 'stop' or Choices == "3" :

For the delete option, there will be an input statement that asks which you'd like to delete. The list will be scaled by numbers starting from the value of 1 as the first one. Once a number is said in the input statement, the input data type is then converted to an integer allowing it to be added to mathematical statements. The input variable ("Deltodo") is then subtracted by one inside the list todo using the "del" statement. 

>Note: An actual list index will start off from the value 0. So to make it user-friendly, the number that'll be inputted by the user will get subtracted by 1 to account for the proper item. 

    del Todo[Deltodo - 1]
    print("Your selected statement has been deleted!")
    print()  

### The output should be the following: 

    Please select an option. Current choices are "Add": 1, "Delete": 2, or "Stop" : 3 to stop:  2
    Please select the number for the item in the list you'd like to remove: 1
    Your selected statement has been deleted!

The last part of the choice segment is the "Stop" function. The purpose of this statement, as previously mentioned, is to stop the loop once you're finished. this was the easiest part of the choices segment since it just required 3 conditionals under an elif.

    elif Choices == "Stop" or Choices == 'stop' or Choices == "3" :
        print('Statement is now stopping')
        print()

And last but not least, an else statement to end the ifs and elifs. This is added to ensure that something can happen if none of my conditions are met. If the conditional goes to the else, the code will loop again.

    elif Choices == "Stop" or Choices == 'stop' or Choices == "3" :
        print('Statement is now stopping')
        print()

Once that is all said and done, the code should look something like this:


    Todo = []
    Choices = ''


    while Choices != 'Stop' and Choices != '3' and Choices != 'stop' :


    print()
    print('Your current todos are:')
    print(Todo)
    print()

    Choices = input('Please select an option. Current choices are "Add" : 1, "Delete" : 2 or "Stop" : 3 to stop:  ')
    print()


    if Choices == "Add" or Choices == 'add' or Choices == "1" :

        Addtodo = input('Please type in something to add to your todo list: ')
        Todo.append(Addtodo)
        print()
        print(Addtodo + ' has been added!')
        print()
    

        elif Choices == "Delete" or Choices == 'delete' or Choices == "2" :

            Deltodo = int(input("Please select the number for the item in the list you'd like to remove: "))

            del Todo[Deltodo - 1]
            print("Your selected statement has been deleted!")
            print()


        elif Choices == "Stop" or Choices == 'stop' or Choices == "3" :
            print('Statement is now stopping')
            print()


        else :
            print('The answer chosen is invalid.')
            print()
