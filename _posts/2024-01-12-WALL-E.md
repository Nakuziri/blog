What do you think the world might be perceived as in the next couple hundred years? Would it be a dystopian world where everything is automated, or would it be completely different? I for one really enjoy the movie Wall-E because it helps convey the idea that this "dystopian world" might be closer than one could truly imagine.

Within the movie Wall-E, you see hundreds of variations of artificial intelligence, all with their purpose. You can take the two main characters Eve and Wall-E for example, Eve, whose full name stood for Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator was created as an AI whose purpose is to scout the earth in intervals to check for a plant because a plant means that there is a form of suitable living on the planet. On the other hand, Wall-E was created as a series of garbage compactors that would attempt to clean up all the trash on planet Earth by making it into compact cubes and stacking them for sorting and future maintenance. This can also go hand in hand with why I love this move, as this shows the route that we as humans might be taking by overpolluting our planet. Auto is also another example of artificial intelligence. He's created to control the ship as an automated system; However, Auto does receive a classified mission by the current president stating that they shouldn't return to Earth since it's become too inhabitable making it worth just residing within space. Due to this, Auto, an AI, even manages to go as far as to resist and defy the captain's orders to return to Earth regardless of new signs and conditions.

Some of these ethical dilemmas could be the responces of robots in certain parts of the movie such as the portions when Auto would try to rid of the plant whilst other robots would support trying to get the plant to its destination. This shows the
